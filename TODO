{-Yay!, it's my handy dandy TODO list for dwmstatusH -}

TODO:

1) Add Licence information
2) Fix the xlib functions. Currently, they are both main functions, but they
   need to be accessible as modules from dwmstatusH Main.hs
3) Add feature to main to push what is the current output string to WM_NAME
   in the root X11 window
4) Add UTC zone support
