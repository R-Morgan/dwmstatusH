{-Yay!, it's my handy dandy TODO list for dwmstatusH -}

TODO:

1) Fix the xlib functions. Currently, they are both main functions, but they
   need to be accessible as modules from dwmstatusH Main.hs

2) Fix UTC string, to not include UTC and the year on the end, since that info
   is clear in the first date-time string.

3) Add multiple time zone abilities. 

4) Add a Makefile for easy compilation
